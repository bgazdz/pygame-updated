Information:
Rico-Ja was created by Robert Gazdziak and Thomas Lesniak for the Fall 2014 UIUC ACM GameBuilders
game buildathon. The game had to be top-down, no code could be created before the event started,
and the theme that was revealed at the start of the competition was YOLO One Life Only.

This game was created and completed in the 12-hour time limit. Updates have been added as listed on the GitHub README.md
